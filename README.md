A weather app, which suggests clothing based on the current weather.

This is meant to be my submission for the final project in CS50.

## About

I am from Sweden, a relatively cold country in the north. Yet I often found it odd when I visited countries in the mediterranean how, despite the temperature being a lot higher, felt a lot more bearable compared to the summers in Sweden. I later found out that this had a lot to do with the humidity and other factors.

At the same time, I have always had a hard time picking the right clothes before leaving my home. Sure, I could always just open a window or walk outside the door, but sometimes when the weather is cold here it is essentially equivalent to suicide. So after suffering through plenty of years either sweating or freezing my butt off, I decided to take the opportunity of making my own weather app. For my own needs, and hopefully someone else's too perhaps.

As it is harder to predict the weather the further into the future you look, I plan to opt for planning just for the current day - but doing it as accurately as possible.
